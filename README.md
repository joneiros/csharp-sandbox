## Operation System Caution
Unlike most of my langauge practice repos, the C# repo assumes you're running a Windows operating system.
Running this repo on Linux/Unix/Mac may be possible, but may require WINE, and may run into package compatibility issues,
as some packages may be explicitly targeted to Windows.

Feel free to experiment!
